Create a list,seqList , of N empty sequences, where each sequence is indexed from 0 to N-1 . The elements within each of the N sequences also use 0-indexing.
Create an integer,lastAnswer , and initialize it to 0.
The 2 types of queries that can be performed on your list of sequences (seqList) are described below:
Query: 1 x y
Find the sequence,seq, at index ((x xor lastAnswer) % N)  in seqList.
Append integer y to sequence seq.
Query: 2 x y
Find the sequence,seq, at index ((x xor lastAnswer) % N) in seqList.
Find the value of element y % size in seq (where size is the size of seq) and assign it to lastAnswer.
Print the new value of lastAnswer on a new line
Task 
Given ,N ,Q and Q queries, execute each query.

Note:xor  is the bitwise XOR operation, which corresponds to the ^ operator in most languages. Learn more about it on Wikipedia.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers, N (the number of sequences) and Q(the number of queries), respectively. 
Each of the Q subsequent lines contains a query in the format defined above.

Constraints

1 <= N, Q <= 10^5
0<=x<=10^9
0<=y<=10^9

It is guaranteed that query type 2 will never query an empty sequence or index.
Output Format

For each type 2 query, print the updated value of lastAnswer on a new line.
